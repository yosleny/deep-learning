Time series forecasting is one of the most applied data science techniques in business, finance, supply chain management, production, etc. It means to forecast or to predict the future value over a period of time. It entails developing models based on previous data and applying them to make observations and guide future strategic decisions. The future is forecast or estimated based on what has already happened by adding a time order dependence between observations. This dependence is both a constraint and a structure that provides a source of additional information.

Time-series anomaly detection plays a vital role in monitoring complex operation conditions. This problem is usually formulated as identifying outlier data points relative to some norm or usual signal. An outlier point is one that behaves unusually in a specific time instance when compared to other values in its time series. 

This project focuses on two main tasks related to time series given a data-set related to data collected by patients from a wearable device. The first tasks aims to predict the next value for a sequence of values, while the second task goal is to detect anomaly behaviour in a set of observations by creating a set of models to accomplish these objectives.
