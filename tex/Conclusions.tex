Our fist task was next value prediction, for that purpose we use an special type of recurrent neural network name Long Short Term Memory. We were able to predit the next value with a mean square error of 54.55, 59.22, 61.74 for x, y and z respectively using a window size of 5 minutes and a window shift of 1 minute. 

We repeat the calculation maintaining the window shift constant and varying the window size from 1 minute to 15 minutes one minute step, then maintaining the window size constant and varying the window shift half a minute step. Mean Absolute Error does not show any significant improvement.

Our second task was to detect anomalies, for that purpose we use an autoencoder to learn a representation of the train data assuming it was normal, then we decide whether a data point was normal or anomalous based on how well our model performs over the test data. We produce a file (.csv) in which for each patients we insert the dates in which an anomalous behaviour occurs.
